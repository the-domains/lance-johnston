Since 1994 I have enjoyed traveling America with camera in hand. I have photographed weddings and families from coast to coast.  I have had the privilege of teaching many aspiring photographers the art and science of photography.  I have been honored by [Kodak][0] and [Fujifilm][1] for photographic excellence, served as president of the [Arkansas Professional Photographers Association][2] and was named Photographer of the Year by multiple photography associations.  I also earned the [Master of Photography][3] and [Photographic Craftsman][4] degrees from PPA, but without question the highest honor is my clients regularly voting me to Arkansas' [Best of the Best ][5] lists year after year.
