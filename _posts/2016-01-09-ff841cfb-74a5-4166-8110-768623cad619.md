**Owner/Photographer**  
**[The Studio][0]**

Since 1994 I have enjoyed traveling America with camera in hand. I have photographed weddings and families from coast to coast, and am equally comfortable on a commercial photoshoot, at an elegant destination wedding or, at a clients home.  I have had the privilege of teaching many aspiring photographers the art and science of photography.  I have been honored by [Kodak][1] and [Fujifilm][2] for photographic excellence, served as president of the [Arkansas Professional Photographers Association][3] and was named Photographer of the Year by multiple photography associations.  I also earned the [Master of Photography][4] and [Photographic Craftsman][5] degrees from PPA, but without question the highest honor is my clients regularly voting me to Arkansas' [Best of the Best ][6] lists year after year.
