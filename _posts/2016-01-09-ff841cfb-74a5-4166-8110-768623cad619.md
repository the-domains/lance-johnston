## Owner/Photographer   
[The Heights Photo Studio][0]

Since 1994 I have enjoyed traveling America with camera in hand. I have photographed weddings and families from coast to coast, and am equally comfortable on a commercial photoshoot, at an elegant destination wedding or, at a clients home.  I have also had the privilege of teaching many aspiring photographers the art and science of photography, being honored by [Kodak][1] for photographic excellence and serving as president of the Arkansas Professional Photographers Association.  I was also named Photographer of the Year by multiple photography associations and earned the [Master of Photography][2] and [Photographic Craftsman ][3]degrees from PPA, but the highest honor is my clients regularly voting me to [Best Of][4] lists year after year.
