## Owner/Photographer   
The Heights Photo Studio

I have operated a photography studio in Little Rock and Conway AR since 1994 offering new-classic photography, timeless images that have a way of capturing the essence of my subjects.  Equally as comfortable on a commercial photoshoot, at an elegant wedding or at a clients home, I have enjoyed traveling America with camera in hand photographing weddings and families from California to Florida,  Colorado to New Hampshire as well as all over the south. My love for photography began in High School and in the first twenty years in business I was honored with many Photographic accomplishments including- 

Professional Photographers of America Photographer of the Year   
Professional photographers of the Ozarks Photographer of the Year  
Arkansas Professional Photographers Photographer of the Year  
Arkansas Wedding Photographer of the Year  
APPA Past President  
13 Kodak Gallery awards for photographic excellence  
Master of Photography   
Craftsman Photographer   
Certified Professional Photographer 

I have also had the privilege of teaching aspiring photographers the art and science of photography.  Most recently I have enjoyed being a standard in the Arkansas **_[Best Of][0]_** lists year after year as voted on by Arkansas readers.
