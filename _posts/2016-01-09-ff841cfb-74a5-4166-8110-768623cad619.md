## Lance Johnston PhotographerOwner/Photographer Lance Johnston Studios  
Lance Johnston Studios have operated in Little Rock and Conway AR since 1994\.  We offer New Classic photography, timeless images that have a way of capturing the essence of my subjects.  Equally as comfortable on a commercial photoshoot, at an elegant wedding or at a clients home.  I have enjoyed traveling America with camera in hand photographing weddings and families from California to Florida,  Colorado and New Hampshire as well as all over the south.  My love for photography began in High School and in the first twenty years in business I was honored with Photographer of the year awards from the Professional Photographers of America the Professional photographers of the Ozarks and the Arkansas Professional Photographers,  13 times given the Kodak Gallery award for photographic excellence and earned 8 different photography degrees including the Master of Photography and the Craftsman Photographer degrees from the Professional Photographers of America.
