## Owner/Photographer   
[The Heights Photo Studio][0]

I have operated a photography studio in Little Rock and Conway, AR since 1994 offering new-classic photography, my work is most often referred to as timeless.  I have enjoyed traveling America with camera in hand photographing weddings and families from California to Florida,  Colorado to New Hampshire as well as all over the south, equally as comfortable on a commercial photoshoot, at an elegant wedding or at a clients home.  My love for photography began in High School and in the first twenty years in business I was honored with many Photographic accomplishments including-

**Professional Photographers of America _Photographer of the Year_  
Professional Photographers Ozarks _Photographer of theYear_

13 _Kodak Gallery awards_ for photographic excellence  
Master of Photography

Certified Professional Photographer**  
I have also had the privilege of teaching aspiring photographers the art and science of photography.  Most recently I have enjoyed being a standard in the Arkansas [Best Of][1] lists year after year as voted on by Arkansas readers.
