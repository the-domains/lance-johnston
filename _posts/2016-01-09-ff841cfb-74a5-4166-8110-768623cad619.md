## Owner/Photographer The Heights Photo Studio

Lance Johnston Photography has operated in Little Rock and Conway AR since 1994\.  offering New Classic photography, timeless images that have a way of capturing the essence of our subjects.  Equally as comfortable on a commercial photoshoot, at an elegant wedding or at a clients home.  We have enjoyed traveling America with camera in hand photographing weddings and families from California to Florida,  Colorado and New Hampshire as well as all over the south.  My love for photography began in High School and in the first twenty years in business I was honored with Photographer of the year awards from the Professional Photographers of America the Professional photographers of the Ozarks and the Arkansas Professional Photographers,  13 times given the Kodak Gallery award for photographic excellence and earned 8 different photography degrees including the Master of Photography and the Craftsman Photographer degrees from the Professional Photographers of America.  most recently I have enjoyed being a standard in the Arkansas _**Best of**_ lists year after year.
