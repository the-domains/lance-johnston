## Owner/Photographer   
[The Heights Photo Studio][0]

I have operated a photography studio in Little Rock and Conway AR since 1994 offering new-classic photography, timeless images that have a way of capturing the essence of my subjects.  Equally as comfortable on a commercial photoshoot, at an elegant wedding or at a clients home, I have enjoyed traveling America with camera in hand photographing weddings and families from California to Florida,  Colorado to New Hampshire as well as all over the south. My love for photography began in High School and in the first twenty years in business I was honored with many Photographic accomplishments including-  
**Professional Photographers of America _Photographer of the Year_  
Professional Photographers Ozarks _Photographer of theYear_  
Arkansas Professional Photographers_Photographer of the Year_  
Arkansas_Wedding Photographer of the Year_  
APPA Past _President_  
13 _Kodak Gallery awards_ for photographic excellence  
Master of Photography  
Craftsman Photographer  
Certified Professional Photographer**  
I have also had the privilege of teaching aspiring photographers the art and science of photography.  Most recently I have enjoyed being a standard in the Arkansas [Best Of][1] lists year after year as voted on by Arkansas readers.
