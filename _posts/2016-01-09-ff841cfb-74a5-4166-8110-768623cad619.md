## Owner/Photographer   
[The Heights Photo Studio][0]

Since 1994 I have enjoyed traveling America with camera in hand. I have photographed weddings and families from coast to coast, and am equally comfortable on a commercial photoshoot, at an elegant destination wedding or, at a clients home.  I have also had the privilege of teaching many aspiring photographers the art and science of photography, being honored by Kodak for photographic excellence and serving as president of the Arkansas Professional Photographers Association.  I was also named Photographer of the Year by multiple photography associations and earned the Master of Photography and Photographic Craftsman degrees from PPA, but the highest honor is my clients regularly voting me to Best Of lists year after year.
