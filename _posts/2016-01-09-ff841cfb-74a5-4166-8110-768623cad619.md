**Owner/Photographer**  
**[The Heights Photo Studio][0]**

Since 1994 I have enjoyed traveling America with camera in hand. I have photographed weddings and families from coast to coast, and am equally comfortable on a commercial photoshoot, at an elegant destination wedding or, at a clients home.  I have also had the privilege of teaching many aspiring photographers the art and science of photography, being honored by [Kodak][1] and [Fujifilm][2] for photographic excellence and serving as president of the Arkansas Professional Photographers Association.  I was also named Photographer of the Year by multiple photography associations and earned the [Master of Photography][3] and [Photographic Craftsman ][4]degrees from PPA, but the highest honor is my clients regularly voting me to [Best of the Best][5] lists year after year.
