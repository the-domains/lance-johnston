## Owner/Photographer   
[The Heights Photo Studio][0]

Since 1994 I have enjoyed traveling America with camera in hand. I have photographed weddings and families from coast to coast, and am equally comfortable on a commercial photoshoot, at an elegant wedding or, at a clients home.  I have also had the privilege of teaching many aspiring photographers the art and science of photography and been honored with many Photographic accomplishments including-

**Professional Photographers of America _Photographer of the Year_  
Professional Photographers Ozarks _Photographer of theYear_  
Arkansas Professional Photographers _Photographer of the Year_  
Arkansas_Wedding Photographer of the Year_  
APPA Past_President_  
13 _[Kodak Gallery awards ][1]_for photographic excellence  
Master of Photography  
Craftsman Photographer  
Certified Professional Photographer**

Most recently I have enjoyed being recognized by Arkansans on the **_[Best Of][2]_**lists year after year.
