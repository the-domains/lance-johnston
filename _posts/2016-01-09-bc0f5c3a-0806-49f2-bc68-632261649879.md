My love of architecture dates back 35 years, drawing floor plans and designing buildings as early as elementary school.  Most of my adult life has been spent involved with one construction project or another including building new homes, remodeling, and historic preservation.  In 2012, I started Lance Johnston Design+Build.  Upon partnering with Michael Harrison in early 2015, Reform Design+Build quickly became a recognized name in the remodeling and construction industry.  Drawing on the same simplicity and sophistication in design that made the name Lance Johnston synonymous with the highest quality of photographic art. Reform Design+Build is already receiving similar [recognition][1].
