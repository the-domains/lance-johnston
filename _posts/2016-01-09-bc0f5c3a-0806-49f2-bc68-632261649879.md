## Owner/Licensed Contractor  Reform Design+Build

My love of architecture dates back 35 years, drawing floor plans and designing buildings as early as elementary school.  Most of my adult life has been spent involved with some construction project or another.  In early 2012 I started Reform Design Build.  Partnering with Michael Harrison in early 2015 firmly cemented Reform Design Build as a leading voice in the construction Industry.

Drawing on the same simplicity and sophistication in design that made the name Lance Johnston synonymous with the highest quality of photographic art. Reform Design Build is already receiving similar accolades.
